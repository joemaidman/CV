## Joe Maidman
Software developer, former financial analyst, keen technologist.

I have followed a passion to become a software developer, completing an intensive developer bootcamp earlier this year after a decade-long career in finance. I am now a software engineer at [Lab49](http://www.lab49.com/), a technology consultancy.

## Technologies

This is a selection of the languages, frameworks and tools I have experience with. My goal is to use the best tool for the job and become a better developer.

<b>Frontend</b> ~ Typescript | javascript | jQuery | Node | React | Redux | SCSS & CSS | CSS </br>
<b>Backend</b>  ~ Java & Lombok | Kotlin | Spring | Hazelcast | Ruby | C# | WPF (XAML) | VBA | MySQL </br>
<b>Workflow</b> ~ Git | Stash | Webpack | Jenkins | Docker</br>
<b>Testing</b>  ~ JUnit | Mockito | Hamcrest | Mocha | Chai | Sinon | React Storybook

## Skills

I am a <b>curious</b> person who enjoys challenging accepted wisdom, questioning what I see around me, understanding how things work and people tick. I relish the unknown. My interests in technology vary and in my self-driven (sometimes slightly strange) projects, I’ve delved into a whole range of subjects from automated trading on betting exchanges to [reverse engineering RF frequencies](https://github.com/joemaidman/blades-in-motion), virtual reality and [cellular automata](http://gameoflife.netlify.com/). My most recent side project, [Bedrock](#personal-projects), is a javascript testing framework. I was curious to explore and solve the challenges involved with building a tool like this which is so critical to my day-to-day workflow. 

I am used to working in an environment of constant <b>change</b> where remaining agile is a critical skill. The great volatility during the financial crisis challenged my perspective on risk and has been at least partly responsible for my decision to make such a bold career change earlier this year. 

I have been fortunate to work as part of a team practising <b>agile methodologies</b> and have experience of both Kanban and Scrum, often working with colleagues distributed around the world. We put strong emphasis on implementing the principles of <b>clean code</b> and test-driven development.


<b>Communication</b> of ideas has been an essential part of my career to date. I relish the opportunity to meet new people and enjoy situations where communication is critical. My previous experience working as a Financial Analyst was all about <b>understanding businesses</b> and the potential impact of their decisions. I worked in a B2B environment dealing with clients on a daily basis.
