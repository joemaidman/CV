## Joe Maidman

Software developer, former financial analyst, keen technologist.

My interests in technology vary and in self-driven projects, Iâ€™ve delved into a whole range of subjects from automated trading on betting exchanges to [reverse engineering RF frequencies](https://github.com/joemaidman/blades-in-motion), virtual reality, and [cellular automata](http://gameoflife.netlify.com/). One of my side projects, [Bedrock](https://github.com/joemaidman/bedrock), is a javascript testing framework. I was curious to explore and solve the challenges involved with building a tool like this which is so critical to my day-to-day workflow.

I have been fortunate to work as part of several teams practising agile methodologies and have experience of both Kanban and Scrum, including working with colleagues distributed around the world. I put a strong emphasis on implementing the principles of clean code and test-driven development.

## Technologies

This is a selection of the languages, frameworks, and tools I have experience with. My goal is to use the best tool for the job and become a better developer.

Analysing and publishing research on [listed investment companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-end_fund), modelling and structuring deals including new share offerings. My experience as an investment analyst meant dealing with large and disparate data sets and combining qualitative and quantitative inputs to reach useful conclusions on a variety of sectors from [technology](http://joemaidman.com/documents/PCT.pdf) to [mining](http://joemaidman.com/documents/BRWM.pdf). Commercial and strategic decisions were made based on my analysis.

As well as face to face meetings and relationship building, I wrote research to encourage engagement and conceived and built a research portal and blog (WordPress) for the team to market our product.

My role was all about understanding businesses and the potential impact of their decisions. I worked in a B2B environment dealing with clients on a daily basis.
